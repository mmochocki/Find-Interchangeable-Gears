'Find-Interchangeable-Gears'

A console program designed to make it easier to find the right sprocket for your machines so that they match your needs. The main objective was to find such sprockets so that the gearmotor cutter rotates at the right speed to obtain the toothed gear with the desired amount of cog.

The following image shows a set of selected shift wheels and illustrates the problem: http://i.imgur.com/SBoIKCC.jpg

There are two versions of the program:

- Main.cpp - program for ordinary gears
- Angle.cpp - gear program taking into account their slope at the right angle

In both programs the parameters of the machine, their module, are taken into account, and the number of sprocket is determined on them. The program checks the correct algorithm for all the variants of the sprocket and adjusts them by displaying the result in the console.
